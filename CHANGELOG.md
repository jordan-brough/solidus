*   Remove Spree::Money preferences

    Removes Spree::Config's `symbol_position`, `no_cents`, `decimal_mark`, and
    `thousands_separator`. This allows us to use the better defaults provided
    by RubyMoney. For the same functionality of the existing preferences,
    `Spree::Money.default_formatting_rules` can be used.

*   Remove SSL preferences and controller helpers

    In production any ecommerce site should use SSL for all connections. It is
    both a security necessity and an SEO gain. Instead of the existing
    configuration, SSL should be configured by the web server, load balancer,
    or through rails.

    For information on configuring rails for SSL see
    http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/ForceSSL/ClassMethods.html
